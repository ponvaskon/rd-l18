# GenAI Music and Video Generator

## Project Goals:
The project aims to create a generative AI solution that takes user input (genre, duration, and a video prompt) to generate a video with audio. The audio is generated using **Meta MusicGen**, and the video is generated using **LTX-Video** (a text-to-video model). The final output combines the generated music with the generated video and serves it through a Flask API.
